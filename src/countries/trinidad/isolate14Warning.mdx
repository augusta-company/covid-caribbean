  <strong>Please self-isolate for 14 days</strong>. You do not need
  testing for COVID-19.
</h3>
<p>
  Since you don't have symptoms, you do not need testing for COVID-19 at
  this time. However, there’s a chance you could get sick since it’s less
  than 14 days since your exposure. You should self-monitor for any
  symptoms (fever, cough, sneezing, sore throat, or difficulty breathing).
  If you begin to develop these, you should take this self-assessment
  again.
